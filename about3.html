Discuss the following cite specific industry issues and experience
<p>a. How do recent approaches to “embodied interaction” differ from earlier accounts
of the role of cognition in human-computer interaction?
<p>b. What is the reason for taking care of design a good computer-human interface?
<p>c. Discuss the pros and cons of human-computer interaction technology?

<p><strong><a href="">a. Recent Approaches to Embodied Interaction vs. Earlier Accounts of
Cognition in HCI:</a></strong>
 Recent approaches to embodied interaction emphasize the importance of
incorporating bodily experiences, gestures, and physical movements into humancomputer
interaction (HCI).
 Unlike earlier accounts that primarily focused on cognitive processes such as
perception, memory, and decision-making, embodied interaction considers the
holistic experience of the user, including their bodily engagement with the
technology.
8
 For example, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) systems utilize
embodied interaction by allowing users to physically interact with digital
environments using gestures, movements, and body tracking.
 This approach aims to create more immersive and natural user experiences by
leveraging the body's capabilities and senses in addition to cognitive processes.
<p><strong><a href="">b. Reasons for Designing a Good Computer-Human Interface (CHI):
 Designing a good computer-human interface (CHI) is essential for several
reasons:</a></strong>
<p><strong>i. User Experience (UX):</strong> A well-designed interface enhances the user experience
by making interactions intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable, leading to increased
user satisfaction and adoption.
<p><strong>ii. Productivity and Efficiency:</strong> An effective interface improves productivity by
enabling users to perform tasks quickly and accurately, reducing errors and
cognitive load.
<p><strong>iii. Accessibility:</strong> A good interface ensures accessibility for users with diverse
abilities and needs, promoting inclusivity and equal access to technology.
<p><strong>iv. Competitive Advantage:</strong> A well-designed interface can differentiate a product or
service from competitors, attracting and retaining customers.
<p><strong>v. Reduced Training Time and Costs</strong> Intuitive interfaces require less training for
users, reducing the time and resources spent on training and support.
<p><strong><a href="">c. Pros and Cons of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Technology:</a></strong>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>
<p>i. Improved efficiency and productivity.
<p>ii. Enhanced user experience and satisfaction.
<p>iii. Accessibility for users with diverse needs.
<p>iv. Facilitation of collaboration and communication.
<p>v. Enablement of new forms of interaction (e.g., touchscreens, voice commands).
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>
<p>i. Potential for user frustration and errors with poorly designed interfaces.
<p>ii. Privacy and security concerns, especially with data collection and sharing.
<p>iii. Dependence on technology may lead to overreliance or addiction.
<p>iv. Accessibility challenges for certain user groups (e.g., elderly, disabled).
<p>v. Ethical implications, such as biases in AI algorithms or misuse of personal data.
<p><strong><a href="">d. Purpose of Each Hadoop Ecosystem Component:</a></strong>
<p><strong>i. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):</strong> Storage layer that stores large volumes
of data across distributed nodes in a Hadoop cluster.
<p><strong>ii. MapReduce:</strong> Processing framework for distributed computation of large datasets,
consisting of Map and Reduce phases.
<p><strong>iii. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):</strong> Resource management and job
scheduling component responsible for allocating cluster resources among
applications.
<p><strong>iv. Hive:</strong> Data warehouse infrastructure that provides SQL-like query capabilities for
data stored in Hadoop.
<p><strong>vv. Pig:</strong> High-level scripting platform for analyzing and processing large datasets.
<p><strong>vi. Spark:</strong> In-memory data processing engine for faster and more flexible data
<p><strong><a href="">processing compared to MapReduce.</a></strong>
<p><strong>vii. HBase:</strong> NoSQL database for real-time read/write access to large datasets.
<p><strong>viii. Sqoop:</strong> Tool for transferring data between Hadoop and relational databases.
<p><strong>ix. Flume and Kafka:</strong> Streaming data ingestion tools for collecting and transporting
large volumes of data into Hadoop.
9
<p><strong>x. Oozie:</strong> Workflow scheduler for managing and executing complex data processing
workflows in Hadoop.
<p><strong>e. Ingesting Streaming Data into Hadoop Cluster:</strong>
 Streaming data can be ingested into a Hadoop cluster using tools like Flume and
Kafka:
<p><strong> Apache Flume:</strong> Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data or event
streams from various sources to a centralized Hadoop cluster.
<p><strong>Apache Kafka:</strong> Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows you to
publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or
enterprise messaging system. It can be used for real-time data processing, event
sourcing, and stream processing. Kafka integrates well with Hadoop ecosystem
components like HDFS, Spark, and HBase, enabling seamless ingestion of
streaming data into a Hadoop cluster.</p>
